**WP User Avatar**

Download the plugin at: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-user-avatar/

**Description**

WordPress currently only allows you to use custom avatars that are uploaded through [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/). WP User Avatar enables you to use any photo uploaded into your Media Library as an avatar. This means you use the same uploader and library as your posts. No extra folders or image editing functions are necessary.

WP User Avatar also lets you:

* Upload your own Default Avatar in your Discussion settings.
* Show the user's [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) avatar or Default Avatar if the user doesn't have a WP User Avatar image.
* Disable [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) avatars and use only local avatars.
* Use the <code>[avatar_upload]</code> shortcode to add a standalone uploader to a front page. This uploader is only visible to logged-in users.
* Use the <code>[avatar]</code> shortcode in your posts. These shortcodes will work with any theme, whether it has avatar support or not.
* Allow Contributors and Subscribers to upload their own avatars.
* Limit upload file size for Contributors and Subscribers.
